# Ray-tracing

This project is based on designing, modeling and rendering a virtual 3-dimensional graphical scene, with most of the physics involved (light
source, rays, reflections, refractions, color, occlusions etc). We added a depth of field feature (in mp1), and BVH runtime improvment feature (in mp2). 
The project is well documented in the code

Our pictures are built in the tests. The final picture is projectTest picture and is built from over 80,000 shapes.
